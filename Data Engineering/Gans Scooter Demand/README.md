## Data-Driven Scooter Distribution for Gans E-Scooter Sharing

#### Project Set Up
Tasked with enhancing the operational strategy for Gans, an e-scooter-sharing startup, I developed a data pipeline to predict scooter movement across urban landscapes. 
This initiative supports the company's mission to ensure scooter availability precisely where and when they're needed, addressing the logistical challenges posed by city topographies, aiport availability, and varying weather conditions.
