## Set Up
Tasked with resolving Eniac's debate on the impact of product discounts, our analysis intended to inform strategic decisions balancing quality market positioning against aggressive discounting tactics.

## Analysis & Tools
Leveraging Python's robust data manipulation libraries such as pandas and regex, our team performed extensive data cleaning to establish data quality and consistency. We categorized products to streamline analysis, enabling a thorough investigation into the discount strategy's effects on sales, especially during seasonal peaks and special events.

## Insights & Deliverables
Through collaborative efforts, we scrutinized sales data against discount percentages and seasonal trends, presenting our findings in a compelling narrative. Utilizing seaborn and matplotlib, we crafted insightful visualizations to support our stance that while discounts may boost short-term sales volume, they do not necessarily contribute to long-term revenue growth. Our analysis culminated in a 5-minute presentation, highlighting the necessity for improved data collection practices and proposing a strategic approach to Eniac's discount policy.
