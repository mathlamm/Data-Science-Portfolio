## Synopsis
Tasked with resolving Eniac's debate on the impact of product discounts, my analysis intended to inform strategic decisions balancing quality market positioning against aggressive discounting tactics.

I took a deep dive into Eniac's data, armed with Python and a toolkit full of pandas and regex magic, to untangle a pretty tangled data set. The task was to
figure out if discounts were really the secret weapon to boosting sales or if they were just in fact hurting profits.

I categorized product using PandasAI, ran quality checks on the data, and leaned on Google's suite of collaboration-fit tools for a group analysis. My goal was to draw a clear, data-backed picture of Eniac's discount landscapeâ€”how deep the discounts went, when they hit, and their real impact on the bottom line. Wrapping up, I put together a straightforward 5-minute presentation to lay out the findings and chart a course for Eniac's discounting strategy, aiming to strike that delicate balance between attracting customers and keeping revenue healthy.
