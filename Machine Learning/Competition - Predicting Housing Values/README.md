### Project Context
I am part of a consultancy specializing in real estate, where pricing is a pivotal aspect of our business. Our team supports developers, agencies, and investors in making informed decisions about property purchases. Traditionally, the value of a property is determined by home appraisers, following a strict, unbiased methodology to ensure fairness in the market. To enhance our decision-making processes, we've employed data science to reliably predict whether the "true value" of a property is above or below the appraised price. We utilized a comprehensive dataset from Ames, Iowa, which includes historical sales prices and about 80 different property features.

### Project Setup
The project's goal was twofold:

1. Develop a binary classification model to determine if houses are priced expensively, competing with colleagues for the highest accuracy on an unlabeled dataset.
2. Construct a regression model to predict actual housing prices, participating in a globally recognized Kaggle competition.

### Tasks and Achievements

#### **Classification Model for Price Categorization:** 
Using a robust Random Forest algorithm and optimizing feature preprocessing, I developed a model to categorize houses as expensive or not. In a tight competition among team members, 
I achieved first place with an accuracy score exceeding 98%. This victory was narrowly secured, with my colleague [Patrick](https://github.com/irnscvngr/) finishing close behind by a marginal difference.

#### **Regression Model for Price Prediction:** 
Competing in a Kaggle challenge, I focused on using various machine learning techniques, where the GradientBoostingRegressor emerged as the most effective. Despite rigorous experiments with feature engineering—like removing highly collinear features and log-transforming skewed distributions to address overrepresentation of lower-priced houses—these modifications had minimal impact on performance. Nevertheless, my efforts positioned me in the top third of the competition leaderboard.
