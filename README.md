# Data-Science-Portfolio

During a 15-weeks Data Science Bootcamp at [WBS Coding School Berlin](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/data-science-bootcamp/) I completed several projects focusing on all facades of data management: Data Engineering, Data Science and Data Analysis. Projects were set up as real-world companies with real case scenarios.

#### Eniac Business Questions [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Eniac%20Cleaning%20Analysis)  

In a 2 week group project for Eniac, I tackled the debate on the impact of product discounts on business growth. Through rigorous data cleaning with Python and pandas, and careful product categorization, I assessed price distributions, discount prevalence and magnitudes, and sales trends influenced by seasonality. Collaborating closely with my team, I utilized seaborn and matplotlib to create visual narratives that guided our conclusive presentation, ultimately steering Eniac's strategic discounting policies with a compelling data-driven story.

#### Predicting Refractive Error in Cataract Surgery [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Clinical%20Data%20-%20Predicting%20Cataract%20Lens%20Power%20in%20Cataract%20Surgery):  

In my final project at WBS Coding School, I developed a machine learning model to predict refractive errors after cataract surgery, using over 5,000 real-world cases. The model aims to assist surgeons in choosing the optimal lens, improving patient outcomes despite challenges with data completeness and model precision.

#### Automated Playlist Generation for Moosic [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Moosic%20-%20Automated%20Playlist%20Generation):  

While *Moosic*s service in offering customoized playlist is scaling up fast, the company is in need for tools to automate playlist generation in support of the music expert team. I used KMeans as a unsupervised Machine Learning method to cluster +5000 songs based on Spotifies aufio features. 

#### Competition - Predicting Housing Values [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Competition%20-%20Predicting%20Housing%20Values):  


As part of a real estate consultancy, I leveraged data science to predict property values in Ames, Iowa, developing models to assess if homes are priced above or below their appraised values and to predict actual sale prices, achieving top ranks in internal and global competitions. This project utilized a dataset containing historical sales data and 80 property features, pushing the boundaries of traditional real estate appraisal with cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

#### Gans Scooter Distribtion [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Engineering/Gans%20Scooter%20Demand): 

In a 2 week project aimed at optimizing e-scooter distribution for Gans startup, I engineered a cloud-based data pipeline that captures and processes urban mobility data. Utilizing Python for data collection and cleaning, and MySQL for storage, I automated the ingestion of real-time data into a GCP SQL instance. This infrastructure enables Gans to strategically position e-scooters based on predictive analytics, enhancing operational efficiency in diverse cityscapes.
