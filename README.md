# Data-Science-Portfolio

During a four month Data Science Bootcamp at WBS Coding School Berlin I completed several projects focusing on all facades of data management: Data Engineering, Data Science and Data Analysis. Projects were set up as real-world companies with real case scenarios.

#### Eniac Business Questions [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Science/Eniac%20Cleaning%20Analysis)  

In a 2 week group project for Eniac, I tackled the debate on the impact of product discounts on business growth. Through rigorous data cleaning with Python and pandas, and careful product categorization, I assessed price distributions, discount prevalence and magnitudes, and sales trends influenced by seasonality. Collaborating closely with my team, I utilized seaborn and matplotlib to create visual narratives that guided our conclusive presentation, ultimately steering Eniac's strategic discounting policies with a compelling data-driven story.



## Data Analysis

#### Testing Magists Potential for Partnership [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Analysis/Magist%20Analysis):  

Analysis of potential online marketplace partership, using mySQl and Tableau. First one-week group effort of the WBS Data Science Boot Camp in March 2024.

## Data Engineering

#### Gans Scooter Distribtion [*go to project*](https://github.com/mathlamm/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Data%20Engineering/Gans%20Scooter%20Demand): 

In a 2 week project aimed at optimizing e-scooter distribution for Gans startup, I engineered a cloud-based data pipeline that captures and processes urban mobility data. Utilizing Python for data collection and cleaning, and MySQL for storage, I automated the ingestion of real-time data into a GCP SQL instance. This infrastructure enables Gans to strategically position e-scooters based on predictive analytics, enhancing operational efficiency in diverse cityscapes.
